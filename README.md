world-series-of-poker
=====================

This is data from the World Series of Poker from 1970 through 2004.
I originally created it to help me with learning XSLT (version 1),
but haven't really had the time to keep it up to date -- in fact,
the algorithm I picked to help hash the names is pretty poor and
should be reexamined.

Still, it hopefully will be of some historical and/or instructional
value for those interested in poker (or how not to code in XSLT).
